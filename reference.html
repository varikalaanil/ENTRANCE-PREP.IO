        <b>Useful  Books for JEE Preparation</b><br/>
Students preparing for the JEE exam must be aware of the books to which they should refer.<br/>
 The best books for JEE Main and IIT JEE Maths, Physics, and Chemistry are those that provide <br/>
 a fundamental understanding of the subjects. Students can take advice from teachers or educators <br/>
 about books they should refer to for JEE preparation. <br/>
 Here’s a list of books for JEE Main and JEE Advanced exam preparation recommended by toppers and experts.<br/>
</p>
<h2>Books for JEE Main Physics</h2>

<h3>Some <span>recomendations </span>by me</h3>
<p>
    These are some of the references that you can follow but for some things LIKE
    <ul>
        <li>For inorganic chemistry your NCERT text book is more than enough</li>
        <li>For organic purpose text plus some refernces you can use </li>
        <li>Physics part DC Pandey's 4 modules plus HC Verma is enough</li>
        <li>In maths Arihent is the best publication that you can refer.</li>
    </ul>
